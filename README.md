# License-Plate-Detection-Project
Automatic number-plate recognition is a technology that uses optical character recognition on images to read vehicle registration plates. Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) has gained popularity during these days along with the improvement of digital camera & advancement in computational capacity. It can be used in existing closed-circuit television (CCTV).
After image or video capturing, the system process can be divided in four parts: The first, introduces the digital image processing. From the camera, images are captured & fed into the system for processing. The second part introduces OCR. Optical Character Recognition usually abbreviated to OCR, involves a computer system designed to translate images of typewritten text (usually captured by a scanner) into machine editable text. Using OCR, we detect the content of number plates. In the third part, the data are extracted from the recognized characters. In the last part the extracted number plate is send for further use cases.
The project focuses on the implementation of an optical character recognition-based technique to detect characters in a number plate. The algorithm can run on a local machine consisting of required libraries and software already installed. The algorithm is also scalable to micro- processing units other than ordinary computers that have an OS such as Windows/Linux.
